# Specification Quality Checklist: CPU Temperature Spike

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Deliberate exception: this is a technical spike whose subject *is* a specific driver (PawnIO)
  and CPU. Those names appear in Context and Assumptions because the decision under test
  (ADR-0002) is about them; requirements and success criteria themselves stay implementation-free
  (no language, crate, or API named).
- "Developer" is the only actor; the spike has no end-user audience by design.
